spek - Superluminous supernova (SLSN) spectra and photometry fitting toolkit.

Toolkit for fitting of spectra and single epoch photometry of superluminous
supernovae with the aim of measuring their temperature and radius.
For high signal to noise spectra it is also possible to fit them for redshift

The basis of the pachage use spectral templates collected by S.Prajs and
C.Inserra. For reference please refer to Prajs et al. 2017a,b
