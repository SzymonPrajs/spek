class Spectrum():
    """
    Generic spectrum class

    Spectrum class for storying, loading and manipulating spectral data from
    any astronomical source. Build in operations include redshifting,
    synthesising photometry and resampling of spectra.

    Either a file name or arrays containing wavelength and flux values must be
    provided. If both get provided the file will still be read but the inputs
    will be overwritten by the values supplied.

    This class is currently expecting to receive wavelengths in Angstroms and
    fluxes in erg/s/cm^2/A. This may be generalised in the future. While the
    class will continue operating all magnitues and other statistics provided
    will be completely non sensical without the correct units.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name : str, optional
        Path to an ASCII file containing a spectrum. The input is expected to
        have a minimum of two columns where the first column contains
        wavelengths in angstroms and the second column fluxes in units of
        erg/s/cm^2/A.

    wavelength : array-like, optional
        Wavelength array for the specta, must be a 1d array of floats with the
        same dimention as the corresponding array of fluxes. Wavelengths must
        be provided in Angstroms. Used if an input ASCII file is not provided.

    flux : array-like, optional
        Flux array for the specta, must be a 1d array of floats with the
        same dimention as the corresponding array of wavelengths.
        Flux must be provided in the units of erg/s/cm^2/A.
        Used if an input ASCII file is not provided.

    redshift : float, optional
        Redshift of the supernova. If no value is provided z=0 will be assumed
        and luminosity_distance will be set to a default value of 10pc.

    cosmology : `astropy.cosmology.FlatLambdaCDM`, optional
        Cosmology object used to compute luminosity distances. If no value is
        provided Planck15 cosmology will be assumed by default.
